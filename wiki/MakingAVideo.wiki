== Recording A Multimedia Video ==

Run Mednafen with the -mmm and -mmmframes arguments.

For example:

mednafen -mmm 1 -mmmframes 5000 -play 1 -mov c:\mymovie.mcm c:\mygame.pce

This would play your movie "mymovie" on the "mygame" rom.  You would record 5000 frames before stopping.  Do not stop the recording prematurely, it will break the recording.

This should produce a "testmovie.mmm" file.

== Transcoding ==

The mmm file isn't useful yet.  It needs to be transcoded with the mednafen-mmmencode program.  It is in the svn, you'll have to compile it yourself.

mednafen-mmmencode testmovie.mmm

Now it will produce a .mov file that can be encoded any way you want.
