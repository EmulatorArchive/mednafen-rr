Windows Users:
Mednafen is command line only.  This can be cumbersome but there are some options.  The first is to create a shortcut to mednafen then right-click the shortcut and go to properties.  Add the commandline options to the target line.

The other option is to download Let's Mednafen:

Load up lmednafen, then set up your window settings.
Then in the "other command-line" box, add -mov [yourmoviename]

This will load your movie into memory when mednafen loads (or create one if it doesn't exist).  Then go to File > Loading files to select your game.

All users:

Once mednafen is launched, you can begin recording by pressing shift+R, or to playback the movie, press shift+P.  To toggle read-only status, press shift+T.

To reassign your controller buttons press shift+alt+1 (for player 1)
To reassign hotkeys press shift+alt+h + the hotkey you wish to modify
